# FiniteElementAnalysis
Matlab/Octave model for analyzing members in torsional and axial loading

This code can be used to analyze members experiencing torsional or axial loading with either one or both ends fixed. It works with members containing elements of varying stiffness, length and other variables. The model uses reduced stiffness matrices to keep the code more concise. There is also the option of using the default values which show the format of the data expected. The inputs and outputs can be use SI or American units as long as base units are being used (Pa not kPa and PSI not KSI etc.)
